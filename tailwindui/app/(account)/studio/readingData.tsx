    'en-US': `A healthy lifestyle involves a balanced diet, regular physical activity, adequate sleep, and effective stress management. Eating a balanced diet means consuming a variety of foods that provide the necessary nutrients your body needs to function correctly, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
  
    Regular physical activity is crucial for maintaining a healthy weight, improving cardiovascular health, and boosting mental well-being. It is recommended to engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise each week.
  
    Adequate sleep is also essential for overall health. Most adults need between 7-9 hours of sleep per night to function optimally. Good sleep hygiene practices, such as maintaining a regular sleep schedule and creating a comfortable sleep environment, can improve sleep quality.
  
    Lastly, managing stress through mindfulness, meditation, or hobbies can enhance both mental and physical health. By incorporating these elements into your daily routine, you can significantly improve your overall well-being and quality of life.`,
